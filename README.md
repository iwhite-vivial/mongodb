This is a quick script to get up and running using PHP to connect to mongo.

To quickly connect, rename the "connection.json.template" file to "connection.json"
DO NOT RENAME THE KEYS. 

```json
{ 
      "server" : "<server_name>",
      "port"   : "<port_number>",
      "username" : "<username>",
      "password" : "<password>"
}
```
